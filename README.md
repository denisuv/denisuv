### âœ¨  Overview  âœ¨

Full Stack and Web3.0 developer with awesome web technical skills, hefty product development experience and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment, looking to create world-class web apps of HIGH STANDARD & TOP QUALITY. My professional coding journey started in 2014(a junior developer from 2012). For years I've had an active interest in the web and modern technology. Being fascinated with its continuous fast progress I set myself for a challenge to become a Web Developer. I enjoy the process of building the web products from scratch. Solving problems and finding the best solutions is a creative process which often pushes us leaving our comfort zone and this is when we are growing, aren't we?
